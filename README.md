#  Analyzing Movie Dataset

## 1. Background
The goal of this project is to analyze the movie dataset that has more than 10000 movies starting from 1960 to 2015. The dataset has a wide range of data available,
but to do the analysis the ones that weren't needed were dropped. The analysis was done to answer few questions regarding the runtime, casting, production companies and budget of the
movie.

## 2. Question: 
  a. Which year has seen more investment year to year?
  
  b. What is the average profit made each year?

  c. What is the highest number of movies made by a single production house?
   
  d. Which actors have cast in most movies?

  e.Does movie runtime affect the revenue of a movie?

  f. What is the average movie runtime of each year?

## 3. Dataset

The dataset was collected from Keggle.com. It consists of 21 columns. For the sake of the analysis, the dataset was trimmed to 11 columns which includes:
a) budget	

b)revenue	

c)cast	

d)director	

e)keywords	

f)runtime	

g) genres	

h) production_companies	

i) vote_count	

j)vote_average	

k) release_year

## 4. Results
Upon analysis, the project will provide insights into the investment trends in the movie industry, average profits over the years, prolific production houses and actors, 
the impact of movie runtime on revenue, and the average movie runtime for each year.
